# Lilypad

For the first time ever, business users and domain experts need to be involved in the actual writing of the software. How do we do this without sacrificing our development workflows and tooling?

Lilypad is an AI engineer platform that **modernizes software development for the LLM era**.

## Why Lilypad?

Prompt engineering is more than writing text - it's an optimization process. Lilypad is an open-source framework that brings software engineering best practices to prompt development with:

- **Automatic versioning** - Every change to your LLM functions are tracked, allowing you to compare versions, A/B test, and roll back when needed.
- **Transparent tracing** - See everything about your LLM call from inputs/outputs to tokens used to response times alongside the exact reproducible code.
- **Collaboration-centric tooling** - Seamless collaboration between software engineers, business users, and domain experts.
- **Actually see progoress** - Annotation tooling to help you understand how your prompts are performing and where they need to be improved. Easily understand if the changes you're making are actually improving quality.
