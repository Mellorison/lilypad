# Self Hosting Lilypad

Lilypad is fully open-source and can be self-hosted in your own infrastructure.

You can also run Lilypad on your local machine.

<Callout type="info">
    **Lilypad is currently in a closed beta.**

    You can self-host the [Free](../pricing.mdx) version of Lilypad without any restrictions. However, the [Pro](../pricing.mdx) and [Enterprise](../pricing.mdx) versions require an [Enterprise Edition (EE)](https://github.com/Mirascope/lilypad/lilypad/ee/LICENSE) license.

    If you're interested in participating in the closed beta, [join our community](https://join.slack.com/t/mirascope-community/shared_invite/zt-2ilqhvmki-FB6LWluInUCkkjYD3oSjNA) and send a message to William Bakst.
</Callout>

__Requirements:__

To self-host Lilypad, you'll need:

1. Python 3.10+
2. PostgreSQL
3. A GitHub or Google account (for authentication)
4. Docker

## Setup

First, you'll need to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Mirascope/lilypad.git
cd lilypad
```

Next, you'll need to install `uv` and the libraries dependencies:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv sync --all-extras
```

Going forward, replace `http://localhost:8000` with the URL where you're hosting Lilypad if not there.

## Authentication

First, you'll need to generate and set JWT secret (e.g. using https://jwtsecret.com/generate).

Then set it in your environment:

```bash
LILYPAD_JWT_SECRET=...
```

Next, you'll need to set up OAuth 2.0 Authentication. You can choose between GitHub or Google:

- Homepage URL: `http://localhost:8000`
- Authorization callback URL: `http://localhost:8000/auth/callback`

### GitHub

To authenticate with GitHub, create a new [OAuth app on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) and set the following environment variables:

```bash
LILYPAD_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
LILYPAD_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

### Google

To authenticate with Google, create a new [OAuth app on Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) and set the following environment variables:

```bash
LILYPAD_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
LILYPAD_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

## Client

First, set your environment variables:

```bash
LILYPAD_SERVE_FRONTEND=true
```

You can optionally set `LILYPAD_REMOTE_CLIENT_URL` to the URL where you're hosting the client separately.

Now, build the client:

```bash
cd client
pnpm i
pnpm run build:notypescript
cd ..
```

## Server

First, you'll need to build the image:

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t lilypad .
```

### Hosted

You'll need to set up a PostgreSQL database and set the following environment variables:

```bash
# PostgreSQL
LILYPAD_DB_HOST=...
LILYPAD_DB_NAME=...
LILYPAD_DB_PASSWORD=...
LILYPAD_DB_PORT=...
LILYPAD_DB_USER=...

# Server
LILYPAD_REMOTE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
LILYPAD_REMOTE_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Run the server:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env lilypad
```

You should now be able to access your Lilypad instance at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Local

Alternatively, you can use Docker Compose to run everything together locally:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

<Callout type="info">
    You'll must update `docker-compose.yml` to match your environment setup.
</Callout>

You should now be able to access your Lilypad instance at `http://localhost:8000`.

Note that this results in a PostgreSQL database running in a container. Should you spin down the container, you'll lose all data.

## Application

In your LLM code, make sure you set the API and Client URLs to point to your self-hosted instance:

```bash
LILYPAD_REMOTE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
LILYPAD_REMOTE_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Now you can use Lilypad as [documented](../docs/quickstart).

<Callout type="warning">
    **Make sure to install the correct package version.**

    The production-stable release of Lilypad on PyPI may not be the same version as the one you're self-hosting.
    Make sure to install the version of Lilypad matching your self-hosted instance.
