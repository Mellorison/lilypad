> [!WARNING]
> __Project is in the early beta phase__
> 
> This means that things like the user interface, database schemas, etc. are still subject to change. We do not yet recommend fully relying on this project in production, but we've found it works quite well in its current stage.

An open-source prompt engineering framework built on these principles:

- Automatic versioning and tracing
- Developer-centric prompt template editor
- Proper syncing between prompts and code
